Hydra is a multi-headed Content Management System.

A CMS on rails is sometimes overkill for small sites with little traffic, but
maybe the features of rails are still desirable.  However putting up 10 separate
instances of an app for your 10 small sites is impractical.

Hydra runs multiple site CMS from one instance.  Like the mythical Hydra, it is
a multi-headed monster that delivers content for multiple sites.

Designed for multiple contributors for each domain.

It is still in alpha stage.

Upcoming features:
  Custom Forms
  Better Security
  User Editor
  Upload Manager
  Prettier Default Layout
